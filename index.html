        <p style="color:rgb(88, 141, 8);font-size:23px;"> The temple of Manjunatheshwara on the hills of Kadri is said to be built[weasel words] during the 10th or 11th century. It was converted to a complete stone structure during the 14th century.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(88, 141, 8);font-size:23px;">The bronze (panchlauha) idol of Lokeshwar (identified as Brahma), about 5 feet high, of the temple is called as oldest of the South Indian temples. It has an inscription dated 968 CE (or 1068 CE[2]), engraved on the pedestal. The inscription states that King Kundavarma of the Alupa Dynasty installed the Lokeshwara idol in Kadarika Vihara.[3] It mentions Mangalore as "Mangalapura". The image has three faces and six arms, and holds and hold flowers in two of the arms. The crown depicts a Dhyani Buddha. The image has an ornate prabhavali, and two attendants. It is very well preserved with enameled eyes. There exist two other undated bronze images of similar craftsmanship, one of them is identifiable as an Avalokiteshwar (called Narayana) and other as Buddha (called Vedavyasa).[4] Another stone inscription in Tulu, Kannada and Malayalam scripts of 12-13th century CE, in temple's kitchen, states that the ruler and the local landlords contributed land for the temple. A 1730 CE text Kadli Manjunath Mahatmyam gives an account of the association with Natha Mantha.</p>

        <h2>Gomukha and water tanks</h2>
        <img src="temple4.jpg" alt="Water tanks" width="300"height="300">
        <p style="color:rgb(88, 141, 8); font-size:23px;">There is a natural spring at an elevated location at the back of the temple. It is called Gomukha. It is believed[weasel words] that the water flows from Bhageerathi river, in Kashi and thereby it gets its name as Kashi Bhageerathi theertha. The water from this spring is let into nine ponds of different sizes adjacent to it. Visitors wash themselves in these ponds before entering the main temple.citation needed
